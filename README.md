- 👋 Hi, I’m Denys Sharpylo (@sharpyld)
- 👀 I’m interested in Economics and Computer Science, and learning about the ways I can mix and apply both of these fields together. 
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing two undergraduate degrees in Quantitative Economics and Data Analytics at Dickinson College.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is related to Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau, or Qlik.
